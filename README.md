Log into DialogFlow and visit the console.
Create a new agent or select an existing one then view the general settings page.
Use v1 of the API (although this does seem to work with v2).
Copy the 'Client Access Token' and paste in place of 'INSERT DIALOGFLOW ACCESS TOKEN HERE' on line 8.
Enable the 'Web Demo' via the 'Integrations' tab.


Get started by enabling the 'Small Talk' pre-built agent and completing the responses.
Develop further by adding your own 'Intents' (Just use 'Phrases' and 'Responses' for a simple website chatbot.
Delve into 'Entities' for more advanced chatbot features similar to functions and variables.
